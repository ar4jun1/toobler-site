                <p>Borrowing the words of Michael Kassner of TechPublic, A future world is now under the construction of more lively in nature. To make an environment which is connecting a world without human touch for humanity. An incredible mixture of hardware, software and connections make the daily hours more timely and generous with each and every activity of our lives. </p>
                <p>It’s possibilities include new products and services that will help protect the environment, conserve energy, increase agricultural productivity, make transportation safer and faster, enhance public safety, and lead to better and more affordable health care. In addition, some products will simply assist busy consumers by providing timely information: thus, a smart refrigerator could remind its owner to buy milk when it is running low.</p>

                        <p>So here personal responsibilities of day to day are placed in the hands of digital technologies. So in order to remember, inform, and do things easier, the interaction of Internet of Things should be implemented in future.</p>

                        <p>Sensing capabilities are significant in all fields, but smart buildings and smart transportation referred to as “built infrastructure,” will represent markets of primary importance. In both fields, there’s a need for many different devices that can span from nodes providing basic monitoring to active nodes with a high computational capability. The rationales for the adoption of Internet of Things in these fields are several, from social to environmental to economical. Energy conservation, environmental control, traffic optimization, infrastructure monitoring, accident prevention, and disaster containment are just some of the fields that can benefit from interconnected sensing devices.

The technological challenge for the implementation of such devices is limited to the integration and packaging of different existing components, as well as the availability of energy harvesters to make the node self-sufficient.

Monitoring is done through small indoor and outdoor modules that are possibly best described as the size of a toilet paper roll. The outside unit monitors like temperature and humidity and lets you know what it “feels like” outside temperature-wise. Inside the module evaluates CO2 levels in your home, and even the sound levels, in case you want to make moves to protect your family against noise pollution as well as actual air pollution.

                            If the CO2 concentration in your home reaches a dangerous level, you can configure the system to send you an alert on your smartphone. Results are stored within the app, and over time, you can use the data to see weather and air quality trends specific to your home, and make plans for outdoor activities accordingly.
